# The PechayCam App

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a client-server application that leverages a trained model to classify plant diseases and estimate their severity in hydroponically grown Pechay.

### Project Structure
This project uses the trained model in the pechay-disease-cnn  repository to predict the plant disease and disease severity and show it in a Graphical User Interface. In addition, this GUI has a database functionality to store the results.
